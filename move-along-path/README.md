# move along path

This ipelet creates an animation for you, by moving a group of objects
along a path.

## Usage ##

You have to create three things:
  1. A group of objects you want to move.
  2. A mark representing the origin of your objects.
  3. A path along which you wish to move the objects.

Select these three things and run `Ipelets->Move along path`.

This will create several new views.  The ith view will show a copy of
the grouped objects (1.) translated such that the mark (2.) is
positioned at the ith point of the path (3.).
