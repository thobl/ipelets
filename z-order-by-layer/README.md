# z-order by layer #

Helper for manipulating the z-order of objects.


## Usage ##

Run `Ipelets → Z-Order by Layer → sort` to change the z-order of all
objects on the page to match the order of their layers, i.e., the
objects on the first layer will end up in the background and the
objects on the last layer in the foreground.  The relative order
between object on the same layer will remain unchanged.
