# Function Plotting Ipelet #

The ipelet lets you plot a function.  It should be pretty
self-explanatory.

## Function Format ##

For the function f(x) you can insert anything that Lua can interpret.
In particular, you can use +, -, *, /, %, and ^ for summation,
subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation,
respectively.  Moreover, you have access to functions such as sin() or
cos().  See the
[Lua documentation](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.7)
for a complete list of available functions.
