# plot function

The ipelet provides very basic function plotting capabilities.  It
should be pretty self-explanatory.

## Function Format

For the function `f(x)` you can insert anything that Lua can
interpret.  In particular, you can use `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, and
`^` for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and
exponentiation, respectively.  Moreover, you have access to functions
such as `sin()` or `cos()`.  See the [Lua
documentation](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#6.7) for a
complete list of available functions.
