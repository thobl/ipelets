This ipelet provides some page numbering features that are not covered
by the built in page numbering mechanism.  To install the ipelet,
download
[pagenumbers.lua](pagenumbers.lua)
and copy it to `~/.ipe/ipelets/` (or to some other directory for
ipelets).

# Usage #

To enable page numbering, add a layer with the name
*pagenumbers_format* to the first page.  The text objects in that
layer are copied to every page where every occurrence of the
placeholder `[page]` is replaced by the current page number.  This is
done every time latex runs.

## Special Layers ##

In addition to the layer *pagenumbers_format* there are other layers
with a special meaning.

***pagenumbers_format*** 

On this layer the format for the page numbers is specified (see
description above).  It is not necessary (and usually not desired)
that this layer is visible.

***pagenumbers_page***

This layer contains the page number and is automatically created on
every page.  To hide the page number on a specific page, just make
this layer invisible.

***pagenumbers_dont_count***

If a page contains this layer, the page count is not increased for
this page.
