This ipelet provides some page numbering features that are not covered by the built in page numbering mechanism of Ipe.  To install the ipelet, download [http://lamut.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/mediawiki/ipe7/images/1/1b/Pagenumbers.lua pagenumbers.lua] and copy it to ~/.ipe/ipelets/ (or to some other directory for ipelets).

== Usage ==

To enable page numbering, add a layer with the name ''pagenumbers_format'' to the first page.  The text objects in that layer are copied to every page where every occurrence of the placeholder ''[page]'' is replaced by the current page.  This is done every time latex runs.

=== Special Layers ===

There are some layers with a special meaning.

; ''pagenumbers_format'': On this layer the format for the page numbers is specified (see description above).  It is not necessary (and usually not desired) that this layer is visible.

;''pagenumbers_page'': This layer contains the page number and is automatically created on every page.  To hide the page number on a specific page, just make this layer invisible.

;''pagenumbers_dont_count'': If a page contains this layer, the page count is not increased for this page.

== Example ==

See the file [http://lamut.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/mediawiki/ipe7/images/4/45/Pagenumbers-example.ipe example.ipe] for an example.
