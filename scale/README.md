This ipelet provides an easy way to scale everything that is not
scaled by the normal scaling operation, i.e., the size of symbols, the
pen thickness, and the size of arrowheads.  To install the ipelet,
download [scale.lua](scale.lua) and copy it to `~/.ipe/ipelets/` (or
to some other directory for ipelets).
