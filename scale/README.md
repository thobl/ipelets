# scale

This ipelet provides an easy way to scale everything that is not
scaled by the normal scaling operation, i.e., the size of symbols, the
pen thickness, and the size of arrowheads.

## Usage

Just select what you want to scale and then click `Ipelets -> Scale ->
scale the unscalable` and enter the factor by which you want to scale.
